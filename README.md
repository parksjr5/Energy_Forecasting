## Project Description

### Project Purpose
Over the course of the semester we have been learning about different machine learning techniques, when they should be used, along with the advantages and disadvantages of them. In this project, I will be working on forecasting the energy usage of appliances. We have not worked a lot with timeseries analysis so this will be a project that will allow me to learn an important technique.

### Expected Outcomes
- Forecast appliance energy usage
- Forecast light energy usage
- Identify if certain features affect energy usage of appliances and lights
- Quantify affect of features if they do affect energy usage of appliances and lights

### Dataset

The dataset I will be using is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and is titled [Appliances energy prediction Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction).<br/>
